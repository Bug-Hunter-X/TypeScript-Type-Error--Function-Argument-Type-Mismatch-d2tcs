This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error. The `bug.ts` file contains a function with a type definition that doesn't match the arguments being passed, leading to a type error. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.ts`, corrects the type definition or input values to eliminate the error.  This example highlights the importance of strict type checking in TypeScript for preventing runtime errors.
